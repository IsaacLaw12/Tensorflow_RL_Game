## Description
This was a final project for a Machine Learning class at Colorado State University. I created a Pygame game in which the player herds sheep into a pen.

I then used Q-based reinforcement learning and TensorFlow to train a model to play the game. For more information on the
project read the report in ```Law-Project.ipynb```.


## To Play the Sheep Herding Game:
### Requirements:
- numpy
- pygame

### Instructions:
- Run by typing "python run_game.py"
- The map can be edited by following the convention in map.txt. '#' is a wall, 'S' is a sheep


## To Train / Run the TensorFlow model:
### Requirements:
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter notebook

### Instructions:
- Start jupyter notebook in the root directory 'jupyter notebook'
- Open ```Law-Project.ipynb``` with jupyter and run the training by executing the code blocks
